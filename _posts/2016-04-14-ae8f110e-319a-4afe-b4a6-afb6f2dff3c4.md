Live your dreams now, to any degree that you can. 

With every purchase. 

Every decision. 

Every hello and goodbye. 

Every assignment. 

Every conversation. 

Every meal. 

Every morning, afternoon, and evening. 

And never, ever, ever look back. 

Reframe every thought, word, and deed from the perspective of the person you've always dreamed you'd be, as if your life was already as you've always dreamed it would be. 

Die to yesterday's illusions and be reborn to the truth of your vision. 

And let's just see if you can handle the torrent of treasures I send your way. 
Your greatest admirer, biggest fan, and truest friend
